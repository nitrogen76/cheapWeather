## Lame dewpoint calculation using easy math.  Will eventually write a query to 
## do the dewpoint math properly if you have a barometer.  Which I don't.  Yet.
## Note this query assumes temperature in SI units, and converts it to
## Stupid American Units.

SELECT (last("temperature_C") - ((100-last("humidity")) /5) ) *1.8+32 FROM "${MEASUREMENT}"
