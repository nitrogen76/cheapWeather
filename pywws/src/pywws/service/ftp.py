"""Upload files to a web server by FTP.

This module uploads files to (typically) a website *via* FTP. Details of
the upload destination are stored in the file ``weather.ini`` in your
data directory. You should be able to get the required information from
your web space provider. If your provider allows SFTP then you could use
:py:mod:`pywws.service.sftp` for greater security.

* Example ``weather.ini`` configuration::

    [ftp]
    site = ftp.xxxx.yyyy.co.uk
    user = xxxxxxx
    password = zzzzzzzzz
    directory = public_html/weather/data/
    port = 21

    [hourly]
    plot = ['24hrs.png.xml', 'rose_12hrs.png.xml']
    text = ['24hrs.txt']
    services = [('ftp', '24hrs.txt', '24hrs.png', 'rose_12hrs.png')]

Run :py:mod:`pywws.service.ftp` once to set the default configuration,
which you can then change. ``directory`` is the name of a directory in
which all the uploaded files will be put. This will depend on the
structure of your web site and the sort of host you use. ``port`` is the
port number to use. 21 is the standard value but your web space provider
may require a different port.

You can upload any files you like, as often as you like, but typical
usage is to update a website once an hour. Each file to be uploaded
needs to be listed in a service entry like ``('ftp', 'filename')``. If
the file is not in your ``work`` directory's ``output`` directory then
``filename`` should be the full path.
