If your installation of gnuplot has the pngcairo terminal available you can
improve the appearance of your plots by using it instead of the normal png
terminal. This directory includes a set of graph templates using the pngcairo
terminal. They also specify colours by name rather than numerical index, and
use small circles for wind direction instead of crosses.
