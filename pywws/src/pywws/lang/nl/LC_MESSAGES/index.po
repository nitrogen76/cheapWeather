"pywws is a collection of Python modules to read, store and process data from"
" popular USB wireless weather stations such as Elecsa AstroTouch 6975, "
"Watson W-8681, WH-1080PC, WH1080, WH1081, WH3080 etc. I assume any model "
"that is supplied with the EasyWeather Windows software is compatible, but "
"cannot guarantee this."

"The software has been developed to run in a low power, low memory "
"environment such as a router or Raspberry Pi. It can be used to create "
"graphs and web pages showing recent weather readings, typically updated "
"every hour. It can also send \"live\" data to services such as `Weather "
"Underground <http://www.wunderground.com/>`_ and post messages to `Twitter "
"<https://twitter.com/>`_."
