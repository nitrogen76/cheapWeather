"""Copy files to another directory.

This module can be used to copy template and graph results to another
directory on your computer. This could be useful if you are running a
web server on the same machine as pywws (or on a machine that's
accessible as a network share).

* Example ``weather.ini`` configuration::

    [copy]
    directory = /home/www/public_html/weather/data/

    [hourly]
    plot = ['24hrs.png.xml', 'rose_12hrs.png.xml']
    text = ['24hrs.txt']
    services = [('copy', '24hrs.txt', '24hrs.png', 'rose_12hrs.png')]

Run :py:mod:`pywws.service.copy` once to set the default configuration,
which you can then change. ``directory`` is the full path of a directory
in which all the copied files will be put.

You can copy any files you like, as often as you like, but typical usage
is to update a website once an hour. Each file to be uploaded needs to
be listed in a service entry like ``('copy', 'filename')``. If the file
is not in your ``work`` directory's ``output`` directory then
``filename`` should be the full path.

If you need to copy some files to a different directory you can copy the
:py:mod:`pywws.service.copy` module to your ``modules`` directory,
making sure that you rename it, for example to ``copy2.py``. This
creates a ``copy2`` service that you can use in the same way, but with a
different ``directory``.
